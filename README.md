# one-more-re-nightmare

one-more-re-nightmare is a regular expression engine that uses the technique
presented in [Regular-expression derivatives revisited](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/turon/re-deriv.pdf)
to interpret and compile regular expressions.

Thanks to Gilbert Baumann for suggesting I use derivatives to compile regular
expressions, and my discrete mathematics teachers for properly introducing me
to finite state machines.
