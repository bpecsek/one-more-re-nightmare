Run `./make-html.sh` to compile the documentation into HTML
documents. Run `./make-pdf.sh` to compile the documentation into a PDF
book.

The documentation is written using the
[Scribble](https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/index.html) markup
language. Note that compiling a PDF book also requires a LaTeX
installation.

Much of the style of both formats was taken from the [Netfarm
book](https://cal-coop.gitlab.io/netfarm/documentation/).
